                    This program allows you to explore the books available from Amazon.com in a more tactile and visual manner than is
                    possible using traditional web based technologies. When you search for books they are returned as visual objects which
                    can be dragged around, or removed by the user (using the red button on a book object). You can also find books which are similar to other books by clicking
                    the green button on a book object. This will cause a number of books to appear that are connected to the original book, in this
                    way it is possible to create visual webs of books and see how they relate to each other.<LineBreak/>
